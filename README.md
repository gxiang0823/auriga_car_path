## Installation

Requirements

* ROS Melodic or later
* Python3


Install packages required by Ipopt

```shell
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran git patch wget pkg-config liblapack-dev libmetis-dev
```

Clone repository to any catkin workspace and compile workspace

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/libai1943/CartesianPlanner.git cartesian_planner
cd .. && catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

**OPTIONAL**: build and install Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL) (recommended for better performance)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL.git

# Obtain a tarball with HSL source code from http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/ and unpack this tarball
tar -zxvf coinhsl-x.y.z.tar

# Rename the directory `coinhsl-x.y.z` to `coinhsl`, or set a symbolic link:
ln -s coinhsl-x.y.z coinhsl

./configure
make
sudo make install

# create symlink for Ipopt
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libcoinhsl.so /usr/local/lib/libhsl.so
# Re-build workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make -DWITH_HSL=ON
```

## Example

Example test case with 6 pedestrians, 3 moving vehicles and 2 static vehicles.

```shell
roslaunch cartesian_planner pedestrian_test.launch
```

**Click anywhere in Rviz window with the `2D Nav Goal` Tool to start planning.**

Generate and run new random case:

```shell
roslaunch cartesian_planner random_pedestrian_test.launch
```
